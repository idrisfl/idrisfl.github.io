<!--
  Before opening a new issue please:
  
  - Verify you have the latest versions of Jekyll and Minimal Mistakes 
    installed by running `bundle update`.
  - Thoroughly read the theme's documentation at
   
    for solutions and to avoid duplication.
  - Ask for help at http://talk.jekyllrb.com/
  
  If none of the above solved your problem, you can continue below.

## Environment

<!--
  Please include theme version, Jekyll version, public git repository, whether 
  you are hosting with GitHub Pages, and the operating system you tested with.

  Issues without a link to a public repository or ZIP file will likely go ignored.
  Being able to see your actual files is necessary to troubleshoot, as most 
  issues stem from invalid/missing YAML Front Matter, a mis-configured _config.yml 
  file, or problematic site content.

- Ruby gem or remote theme version:
- Jekyll version:
- Git repository URL:
- Hosted on GitHub Pages (if yes provide URL to site):
- Operating system:
